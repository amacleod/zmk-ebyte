# zmk-ebyte
ZMK module for the Ebyte E73-2G4M08S1C surface mount MCU module

NOTE: It turns out that my creation of this repo was misguided. Rather than creating a board for the E73, what I should have been doing is creating a board for the split keyboard as a whole.
Please see https://github.com/amacleod/lotus58-ble-zmk for that.
